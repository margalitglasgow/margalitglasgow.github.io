= Teaching
I love teaching students math and engineering, and I am lucky to have had the opportunity to teach students of all ages throughout my time as a student and researcher. 

Here are some of my write-ups of lesson plans for school-age students that I have designed.

*[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ZbkogA1ysxA1NQCJBZDQxVfvna1_EfBvuAVBzcrblc/edit Building Full Adders] for middle/high schoolers* My first experience building full-adders was on a trip to the [https://www.greenhouse.org.il/Profile.html Ecological Greenhouse at Kibbutz Ein-Shemer] in Israel through MIT's Global Teaching Lab program. There, I worked with students to build a full adder using water-based logic gates (picture on left)! Since I loved building full adders so much, I taught a workshop on building transistor-based full adders to kids while biking across the US on [http://web.mit.edu/spokes/www/ Spokes].

*[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1STc3466CGCSMdM2-3MH4D_K4bLbw1pYw Finite Cellular Automata] for grades 1-4* In the fall and winter quarters of 2019-2020, I was an insructor in the [http://mathcircle.stanford.edu/ Stanford Math Circle] for grades 1-4. During the winter quarter, my co-instructor, Felipe Hernandez, and I designed and taught a this curriculum on finite cellular automata. 

*[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clAHiLZJN2ER_4Wh6UUF-O3NMnVIP91okNi_UZMU99Q/edit?usp=sharing Workshops in Coding Theory] for middle/high-schoolers*. These workshops were partially taught in [https://stanfordesp.org/ Stanford Splash] and Stanford Math Circle, and designed for my final project in [http://web.stanford.edu/~marykw/classes/CS250_W19/ CS250].

Recently I've been working more with underserved high school students on math. Right now, I mentor for high-school Algebra students through the Oakland Serves program. During my time at Stanford, I tutored high school students at [https://www.liveinpeace.org Live in Peace]. During my junior and senior years at MIT, I taught freshman multivariable calculus enrichement seminars for [https://ome.mit.edu/programs-services/seminar-xlle Seminar XL].

I have gotten to try some of the lessons out at Stanford Splash and Stanford Math Circle.
