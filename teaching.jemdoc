I love teaching students math and engineering, and I am lucky to have had the opportunity to teach students of all ages through MIT and Stanford.

In the fall and winter quarters of 2019-2020, I was an insructor in the [http://mathcircle.stanford.edu/ Stanford Math Circle] for grades 1-4. During the winter quarter, my co-instructor, Felipe Hernandez, and I designed and taught a [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1STc3466CGCSMdM2-3MH4D_K4bLbw1pYw curriculum] on finite cellular automata. 

For my final project in [http://web.stanford.edu/~marykw/classes/CS250_W19/ CS250], I wrote [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clAHiLZJN2ER_4Wh6UUF-O3NMnVIP91okNi_UZMU99Q/edit?usp=sharing lesson plans] for a series of fun workshops for middle/high schoolers in coding theory. I have gotten to try some of the lessons out at Stanford Splash and Stanford Math Circle.

During my junior and senior years at MIT, I taught freshman multivariable calculus enrichement seminars for [https://ome.mit.edu/programs-services/seminar-xlle Seminar XL].

In my senior year, I mentored high schoolers at [http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/circle/index.php MIT PRIMES Circles] in group theory. #Here is an [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15nr0fe9b6kapWK6HKoOkFT0BT6_CXY_6qTCND4nZj64/edit?usp=sharing in-progress write-up] of the curriculum.

In 2016, travelled to Israel on MIT's Global Teaching Lab program to teach at the [https://www.greenhouse.org.il/Profile.html Ecological Greenhouse at Kibbutz Ein-Shemer]. There, I worked with students to build a full adder using water-based logic gates (picture on left)!

Since I loved building full adders so much, I taught a workshop on building transistor-based full adders to kids while biking across the US on [http://web.mit.edu/spokes/www/ Spokes]. Here is a [https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ZbkogA1ysxA1NQCJBZDQxVfvna1_EfBvuAVBzcrblc/edit write-up] of the lesson plan for the workshop.

Here is one of my favorite pieces on math education: [https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf A Mathematician's Lament].
