<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>I love teaching students math and engineering, and I am lucky to have had the opportunity to teach students of all ages throughout my time as a student and researcher. 
</p>
<p>Here are some of my write-ups of lesson plans for school-age students that I have designed.

<td align="left"><p><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ZbkogA1ysxA1NQCJBZDQxVfvna1_EfBvuAVBzcrblc/edit" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Building Full Adders</a> for middle/high schoolers</b> My first experience building full-adders was on a trip to the <a href="https://www.greenhouse.org.il/Profile.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ecological Greenhouse at Kibbutz Ein-Shemer</a> in Israel through MIT's Global Teaching Lab program. There, I worked with students to build a full adder using water-based logic gates (picture on left)! Since I loved building full adders so much, I taught a workshop on building transistor-based full adders to kids while biking across the US on <a href="http://web.mit.edu/spokes/www/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Spokes</a>.

<p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1STc3466CGCSMdM2-3MH4D_K4bLbw1pYw" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Finite Cellular Automata</a> for grades 1-4</b> In the fall and winter quarters of 2019-2020, I was an insructor in the <a href="http://mathcircle.stanford.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Stanford Math Circle</a> for grades 1-4. During the winter quarter, my co-instructor, Felipe Hernandez, and I designed and taught a this curriculum on finite cellular automata.

These workshops were partially taught in <a href="https://stanfordesp.org/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Stanford Splash</a> and Stanford Math Circle, and designed for my final project in <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~marykw/classes/CS250_W19/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>CS250</a>.

<p>Recently I've been working more with underserved high school students on math. Right now, I mentor for high-school Algebra students through the Oakland Serves program. During my time at Stanford, I tutored high school students at <a href="https://www.liveinpeace.org" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Live in Peace</a>. During my junior and senior years at MIT, I taught freshman multivariable calculus enrichement seminars for <a href="https://ome.mit.edu/programs-services/seminar-xlle" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Seminar XL</a>.
</p>
<p>Here is one of my favorite pieces on math education: <a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>A Mathematician's Lament</a>.
